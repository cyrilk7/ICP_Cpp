# ICP_Cpp
Route finding program using C++
This program displays a path to get from a start city to destination city. To test the program, the accra-tokyo.txt file referenced in the main method 
must be replaced with a desired input text file with the start and destination configuration seperated by a comma as such "Accra, Ghana". Some configurations used in the testing of this program include:
Accra, Ghana to Abuja, Nigeria
Accra, Ghana to New York, United States
Sochi, Russia to Winnipeg, Canada
Accra, Ghana to Winnipeg, Canada
Accra, Ghana to Tokyo, Japan
Seoul, South Korea to Thule, Greenland
etc.
Make sure to include the input txt file in the cmake build folder. The output file is saved to that folder as well.
